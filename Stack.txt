Stack is just data structure that follow last in first out flow. We can call LIFO as well.

The operations that you guys can perform on stack:

1. isEmpty()
2. isFull()
3. Push
4. Pop
5. Peek


We will create 2 files:

1. Stack.java
    This file will contains whole stack implementation of every method that we have discussed so far.
2. StackDemo.java
    This is the file in which we will use our stack data structure.
