# Stack Using Arrays  

This repository contains the implementation of a **Stack Data Structure** using arrays in Java.  

## **Overview**  

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle. This means the last element inserted into the stack will be the first one to be removed.  

### **Operations on Stack**  

The following operations can be performed on a stack:  

1. `isEmpty()` – Checks if the stack is empty.  
2. `isFull()` – Checks if the stack is full.  
3. `push()` – Inserts an element onto the stack.  
4. `pop()` – Removes the top element from the stack.  
5. `peek()` – Returns the top element without removing it.  

## **Project Structure**  

This project contains two files:  

1. **Stack.java**  
   - Implements the stack using an array.  
   - Contains all the stack operations mentioned above.  

2. **StackDemo.java**  
   - Demonstrates the usage of the `Stack` class.  
   - Performs different stack operations.  

## **How to Run**  

1. Clone the repository.  
2. Compile the Java files:  
   ```sh
   javac Stack.java StackDemo.java
